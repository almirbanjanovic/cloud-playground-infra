# APIM Lab

This environment demonstrates Azure API Management (APIM) concepts and configuration for hands-on learning and experimentation.

## What is APIM?
Azure API Management (APIM) is a fully managed service that enables organizations to publish, secure, transform, maintain, and monitor APIs. It acts as a gateway between API consumers and backend services, providing features such as security, analytics, rate limiting, and developer portals.

For a detailed overview, see the official [APIM Key Concepts documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts).
